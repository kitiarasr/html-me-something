    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
    Hello, my name is Kitiara Rivera, and I aspire to be a web and app developer. I enjoy drawing,
      watching movies, listening to music, and learning new things. I am also a foodie and like to try
      new kinds of food. I also have the same attitude with music and movies. The more I can watch, the
      better. Music, movies and the Internet are like a window into the world, and I like to learn
      as much as I can to open my mind to different ideas.
      My career aspirations developed in high school, when I was interested in fixing computers. I didn't
      know programming was a computer job at the time, and my school didn't offer classes in it, so the
        subject alluded me until college.
      My dad would tell me he wanted to major in Computer Science in college, but due to having me as an
      obligation at a young age, he went for a less rigorous degree. And I feel that I want to be able
      to accomplish that dream for my dad. I feel that I owe that to him.
        In the beginning, Computer Science was accompanied by growing pains. I lacked confidence in my
      performance in my classes, and I was intimidated by being one of a few women in my college courses.
      But this all changed thanks to the encouragement of a programming professor of mine. He has been
      my mentor for years, and I trust him wholheartedly. Without him, I don't think I would have continued
      Computer Science. </p>

<p>Places I'd like to visit:</p>
<p></p>
<article>
  <a name="paris">
    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Europe/France/Paris/paris-attractions-xlarge.jpg">
    <p class="paragraphs">Known for its pastries and bread, Paris is a place I would like to visit mainly for their food.
      Their baked goods and sceneries are something to see at least once in a lifetime.</p>

<a name="japan">
  <h2>Japan</h2>
<img src="http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/jnto2wm/wp-content/uploads/1608_special_TOTO_main.jpg">
  <p id="japan"> From their anime cosplaying to their ancient rituals, Japan is a breathaking place to visit and
    see all there is to their culture. The reasons I'd like to visit include their unique food, culture,
    and innovations.</p>
<a name="california">
  <h2>California</h2>
<img src="http://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/San-Francisco-Silicon-Valley-California-Bay-Area.jpg">
  <p class="paragraphs"> Even though California is not too far from home, it is still would be a one of a kind experience
    to visit this progressive state. I think since its so much in contrast to the state of Florida, where
    I live, I would like a taste of what it would be like to live in a state with completely differing
    values. Who knows, I may decide to live here one day!</p>
